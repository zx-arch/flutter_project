# 🛍️ Flutter Project Showcase

The project is located inside the `lib/src/mini_project/` directory. You are free to organize your practice apps within this folder.

If your project has multiple steps or stages (like tutorials or progressive builds), place each in a separate subfolder, such as:

```
lib/
└── src/
    └── mini_project/
        └── another_project/
```

This makes it easy to keep progressive examples or multiple mini projects well organized.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- ✅ Flutter SDK (3.x recommended)
- ✅ Dart SDK
- ✅ Any modern IDE (VS Code, Android Studio, etc.)

3. **Run the app:**
